# What's up chat app
What's up chat app is  made using Socket.IO which is a JavaScript library for realtime web applications. 
It enables realtime, bi-directional communication between web clients and servers. 
It has two parts: a client-side library that runs in the browser, and a server-side library for Node.js.

Using this app many people can interact with each other and when new user will join the other participant will get notified like real apps.
